This project is a robust user authentication and role management system built with React and Redux. It features a dual login interface, allowing both regular users and admins to securely access their designated dashboards. At the heart of this system is a Super User with the authority to register new users and toggle rolesâ€”promoting a user to an admin or demoting an admin to a regular user, ensuring dynamic role management.

User and admin data, along with their roles, are securely stored and managed in Redux, ensuring a consistent and reliable data flow across the application. The authentication flow is designed to route users to the appropriate dashboard upon login: admins gain access to the admin dashboard, while regular users are directed to a user-specific dashboard. This project is ideal for applications that require strong access control and user role customization.
